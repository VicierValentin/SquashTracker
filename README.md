## Data Storage

**📊 Yes, this app CAN store data like IDs and match results!**

The app uses **browser localStorage** to persist all data locally on your device, including:
- User profiles and credentials
- Tournament information
- Match results and scores
- Player standings
- Activity audit logs

**Important Notes:**
- ✅ Data persists across browser sessions
- ✅ Works offline after initial load
- ⚠️ Data is stored locally per browser/device (not shared between users)
- ⚠️ Data can be lost if browser cache is cleared

For detailed information about data storage capabilities, limitations, and recommendations, see [DATA_STORAGE.md](DATA_STORAGE.md).

**Quick Summary:**
- **Personal use**: Perfect for tracking your own tournaments on a single device (default mode)
- **Multi-user tournaments**: Multi-user mode is now available! See [Multi-User Setup Guide](docs/MULTI_USER_SETUP.md)

## Multi-User Mode (Optional)

🎉 **NEW**: Multi-user support is now available via Firebase!

Enable shared tournament data across multiple users and devices:
- ✅ Real-time score updates visible to all users
- ✅ Shared tournament management
- ✅ Cloud-based data persistence
- ✅ Proper email/password authentication

**To enable multi-user mode**, follow the [Multi-User Setup Guide](docs/MULTI_USER_SETUP.md).

**Default mode** uses localStorage (single-user, single-device) and requires no setup.
